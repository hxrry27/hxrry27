- 👋 Hi, I’m Harry
- 👀 I’m interested in learning to code, as I'm interested in transitioning my career into development (either web development or game development).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java, with intention of moving to JavaScript, React and potentially then HTML and CSS afterwards.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on literally anything - all good experience :)
- 📫 To reach me just drop me a message on discord @hxrry27
